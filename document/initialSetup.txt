1. Download Github, NodeJs, WebStorm(IDE) and MySQL (optional: MySQL Workbench)

2. Check out the code from our github reps

    >/  git clone https://github.com/sctravel/scTravel_staging.git

3. Setup MySQL and Create a database named "sctravel"
  (best with the username: root, and use the password in node_modules/createDBConnectionPool.js file,
    otherwise, you need to modify your mysql root password when you are testing locally)

4. Go to node_modules directory.
    >/ cd node_modules

   Run two scripts (createTables.js and loadDataToTables.js) to create the tables and load the data into the tables

   >/ node createTables.js

   >/ node loadDataToTables.js

5. Back to the project directory and start service.

   >/ cd ..
   >/ node app.js

6. Finally you can see the website on
